# `djr`

Perhaps the fastest Djot parser ever?

</div>

`djr` is a command line [Djot](https://djot.net/) parser, based on the `djot.rs`
pull parser implementation of Djot, which is hosted on
[Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~kmaasrud/djot/).

**NOTE**: `djot.rs` is not finished yet, which means this binary does not do
much. If you want to help out, send me a mail through the `djot.rs` development
mailing list: [`djot-dev`](https://lists.sr.ht/~kmaasrud/djot-dev).
