# `djr`

Perhaps the fastest Djot parser ever?

`djr` is a Djot parser written in Rust. This repo holds the binary that let's
you use `djr` from the command line. The full library is hosted on
[Sourcehut](https://sr.ht/~kmaasrud/djr/).

**NOTE**: `djr` is not finished yet, which means this repo does not do much. If
you want to help out, send me a mail through the `djr` development mailing list:
[`djr-dev`](https://lists.sr.ht/~kmaasrud/djr-dev).
